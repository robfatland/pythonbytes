# PythonBytes Club

Started in the 2018--2019 school year we ran a middle school Python club
[.](https://github.com/robfatland/ops) Certainly some students got something from it but 
there is vast room for improvement. The basic premise is: Set up a working environment, 
learn basic vocabulary and syntax, start to internalize programming style and structure, 
and start working on problems that are non-trivial. This last step was missing from the
'basic learning' we did at the start of the year; and the transition to project thinking
proved to be very difficult particularly as the students didn't have persistent exposure
to where the basics became second nature. 

## Main ideas

> Introduce the idea of programming *AWAY* from the computer. Students really need to be able to diagram what they want to accomplish (say on a paper tablet or a white board) using their arms without distraction from the REPL interface and the keyboard. As an example the students will need the concept of a variable as essentially three components: A label, a value and a type. I draw this as a bucket with a label on the outside and the type written below and the value sitting inside the bucket. So the point is to understand the concepts and fit them together into a diagram-plan before trying to write the code. Skipping the diagram phase does not work well for anything even slightly algorithmic. Same thing with concepts: Typing in 'a = 3' is much less useful than drawing a bucket with an 'a' on the outside and a 3 on the inside and 'integer' written below. This also helps in distinguishing '3' as a numerical value and '3' as a string. 

> Provide structure. Don't say "Here are five projects: Choose one of them and get started on it." Rather say "Here is one project, which will be print out several rows of the Pascal Triangle. You must write the code that does this out to thirty rows including dealing with the larger numbers without making the triangle look yucky." And so on... most students in this age category do not do well with open-ended assignments; so stay very structured and specific.

> Explore lock-step coding, partner coding, etcetera. And revisit the points formalism because the silent auction in the final party
was hugely successful.


## More expansively, the lessons learned from 2018-2019

- The code of conduct signed by students and parents is ***essential*** to set expectations
  - Update the 2018-19 to match the new club plan
- We appreciate the locally-built learning environment (first half of the year) but recommend moving to [repl](http://repl.it).
  - Python 3, PyGame, turtle graphics all supported
  - Good project storage / management facilities
  - Active participating community
- One 90 minute session per week works as *intro exposure* but is insufficient for *I can write Python programs*.
  - There should be some (if episodic) dedication outside of club time to reinforcing skills
- Coaches should receive extensive coaching (more than was done in 2018-2019)
  - Emphasis on finding which students are stuck
  - Emphasis on 1:1 coding with those students who are stuck
  - Emphasis on the concept basis: 'What is a variable?' and 'What is flow of execution?' as whiteboard discussions
  - Emphasis on planning out programs without using the computer (line myopia)
  - Emphasis on finding victories and positivity
- Wholistic approach from day 1: 'We are here to write programs'
  - learn everyone's name and where they are coming from
  - build in kinesthetics
  - concept basis (OS, bash, variables, flow of control, language-programming parallels...)
  - vocabulary
  - syntax
  - working away from the keyboard
  - debugging
  - scoping and solution building (works-to-works)
- Projects must not be optional/freeform but structured/directed
  - Revisit existing material with a transformative eye on this change in approach
  - For guided coding the "do likewise" rejoinder (in your out-of-club time) should be a softer climb
- Scale via a sufficient number of capable project leaders
  - Emphasis working in small increments
- Unsolved: How to deal with distracted students?
  - Don't be the students' friend; be someone who has valuable time in mind.
    - "I need you to get value out of this club: you have to close the video game and return to this lesson..."

## Other topics

- IDLE
- Minecraft
- Data science
  - ...but hand-holding and expense might be insurmountable obstacles
- Is GitHub worth introducing? Probably not
- Jupyter notebooks via Binder: Probably yes
  - Open in binder links should be added to this repo
