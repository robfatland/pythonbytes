# PythonBytes Club


Welcome to Year 3 of the club! We began it in 2018. You will need


- A coding environment
- Some guidance whether your are new or experienced 
- Project ideas
- Support for when things are not working


Use the club Slack channel: It is your main resource. Some project ideas are listed [here](http://bit.ly/pythonbytes).


Read the **Main ideas** below to get an idea of what to expect on your computer programming journey. Again **welcome!!**


## Main ideas


* The best place to work on computer programming is *away* from your computer. Why do you think I'm saying this?
    * Answer: Computer programming requires you to organize ideas. The computer interface can distract you from this process. 


* Computer programming begins with building an accurate *framework*. What do we mean by this, a *"framework"*?
    * Answer: A *framework* is an accurate picture of how computer programs work. It is easy to just start writing code without the framework; but it will get *frustrating* when you get stuck without that framework view to get you through.
    * Test yourself: See if you can describe a `variable`. If you can't: No problem, that's why we build the framework vocabulary.
    

* How much time does the club require?
    * Answer: You should make time every day for 15 minutes of coding. More is better; 15 is the minimum.
    * Otherwise you will forget what you are doing and have to repeat or get frustrated.


* What environment should I use?
    * Use Slack to coordinate this. For Level 2: Set up an account on [`repl.it`](https://repl.it). It stores your work for you.
    * If you can install Python on one of your computers you can use the IDLE text editor; so that is a good way to go. 
    * Other online options include [**atom**](https://atom.io) and [**TechSmart**](https://techsmart.codes)
    * Another option: Install **PyCharm**
    * Another option: Install **Anaconda** with support for IPython notebooks


* Where is this website that I'm reading at the moment located? 
    * Answer: It is located on [GitHub](https://github.com), a free content-hosting service. We use GitHub to share ideas and code.


* What are we going to do when we start?
    * Answer: In Level-2 we are going to start of doing *not one*, *not two*, but ***three*** mini-projects together. This will take us a few weeks. 
    * After that we will start doing self-chosen projects; you can choose. OR you can request more group projects.
    
    
* What about the teams of four students?
    * Answer: Get to know your team members; ask one another for help; or give help; compare your results; have fun; make friends!
    * You can do team projects where each person contributes a piece of the puzzle.
