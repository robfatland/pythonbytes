# PythonBytes Club

Started in the 2018--2019 school year we ran a middle school Python club
[.](https://github.com/robfatland/ops) Certainly some students got something from it but 
there is vast room for improvement. The basic premise is: Set up a working environment, 
learn basic vocabulary and syntax, start to internalize programming style and structure, 
and start working on problems that are non-trivial. This last step was missing from the
'basic learning' we did at the start of the year; and the transition to project thinking
proved to be very difficult particularly as the students didn't have persistent exposure
to where the basics became second nature. 

## Lessons learned from 2018-2019

- Having a code of conduct signed by students and parents is ***very powerful*** as it sets expectations
  - The old version should be updated to match up with the new club plan
- We used a locally-built learning environment for the first half of the year; but this ran into some problems
  - There was no way to get technical issues addressed in a timely manner
  - No support for PyGame (which many kids want to use) 
  - We found that [repl.it](http://repl.it) took some learning but was technically much more solid
    - It supports turtle graphics
    - It supports PyGame
    - It stores projects and they persist; they do not evaporate
    - It has many more useful features
- The tempo (once per week; 90 minutes) was not helpful; there was insufficient timely reinforcement
  - Novice programmers were not spending time outside of club meetings honing their skills
  - The learning website was treated like a video game: Solve this puzzle, move on (no retention)
  - The students were not well-engaged with the coaches, particularly the high school student coaches
  - As a result the students -- particularly novice students -- became frustrated and did not develop a sense of their own competence
  - I recommend as strongly as possible beginning with a wholistic approach from day 1
    - Your task is to translate an idea or task that you understand to a program the computer executes
    - To do this well you need a vocabulary and syntax for Python
    - To do this well you need to be able to articulate the task away from the computer
    - To do this well you need debugging skills
    - To do this well you need a sense of project scope: How much is there to do? How much have you done so far?
- The projects web page was visited by students but not taken seriously
  - This boils down to lack of competence (see above) combined with lack of guidance
    - Guiding a single student into and through a single project can take an hour
    - Guiding groups of students through the same project is a way of scaling up -- to a degree
    - While one teacher guides four students: 56 students are left idle
- The idle students problem is the number one issue where we need to improve the club
  - The only way to make progress is to scale
  - The only way to scale is to appoint enough capable project leaders
    - These leaders must in turn be capable of directing work in very small increments
- The high school students were initially excited at the prospect of working with the middle school students
  - However it soon became apparent that they did not have enough direction to be effective
  - Addressing this will be an ongoing task; not a "train and release" process

## Other topics

- IDLE
- Is Minecraft (via Python API) an option? Students like the idea...
  - ...but hand-holding and expense might be insurmountable obstacles
- Is GitHub worth introducing? Probably not
- Jupyter notebooks via Binder: Probably yes
  - Open in binder links should be added to this repo
