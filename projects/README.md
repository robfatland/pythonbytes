## Some more project detail, with links to even more


### :star: Project: Art Concepts


**You are an artist who uses computer graphics to produce graphical themes and patterns: Existing and new**


<img src="https://github.com/robfatland/pythonbytes/blob/master/projects/art/mondrian.png" alt="drawing" width="280"/>


This is an abstract painting by Dutch painter Piet Mondrian. 


The idea of this project is to research artists and artistic themes with the idea of creating similar graphical elements 
using Python. You might begin with Turtle graphics but there are many other ways you can proceed.  There are even 
[books](https://www.makeartwithpython.com/book/) devoted to making art using Python. Read more about this project
[at this page](https://github.com/robfatland/pythonbytes/tree/master/projects/art#pythonbytes-project-in-depth).


### :star: Project: Bees and Drones


**A farmer wishes to use drones to locate some beehives on her orchard so she can cultivate them and have a better harvest.**


<img src="https://github.com/robfatland/pythonbytes/blob/master/projects/bees/baobab.png" alt="drawing" width="280"/>


You are a farmer. You have an orchard 2000 meters x 2000 meters. Notice that locations in your orchard can be
represented using *(x, y)* coordinates. Your trees (they are baobab trees) go up quite high, as high as 30 meters; 
so we can think of the height above the ground as a third coordinate *z*. Hence a location in your orchard can
be written **(x, y, z)**. For example **(16, 12, 5)** would be a point 20 meters from the corner of the orchard and 
5 meters above the ground.  


Seeing a few bees buzzing about -- honey bees I should say -- you have determined that there are some bee hives 
in your orchard. However the tall trees make them hard to locate... but you have a small supply of drones that 
can travel to any location (x, y, z) in your orchard and count the number of bees there. The drone turns off its
propellers for a moment and uses a microphone to count the number of bees nearby. Then it flies back to your 
house and reports how many bees it found.


Unfortunately there is a small chance that your drone will get caught in a tree and be lost to you each time 
you send it out to count bees. (Perhaps the bees recover the lost drones and use them for their own purposes.
If you understand this joke please explain it to your parents.)

### :star: Project: Converging Bugs


**You are observing some bugs placed on a table. They follow some rules for motion and your task is to simulate this.**


<img src="https://github.com/robfatland/pythonbytes/blob/master/projects/bugs/bug.png" alt="drawing" width="280"/>


Ok maybe they are Volkswagon bugs in a gigantic soccer stadium... doesn't matter; same problem! 


What problem? Well it is a famous math problem that can be solved using some logic. 
Whether you solve it or not you can certainly explore the problem using a Python program. 
Because this project is a lot of fun we encourage you to

### :star: Project: Pi from Py


**There are many ways to calculate pi using a computer; so learn to build and compare them**


One of the most fundamental ideas in computer programming is the loop: Doing a task over and over again (each
time in a different way) until a much larger task is completed. Humans rapidly tire of such tasks since we are
busy with other tasks at the same time... like eating lunch and singing songs. So imagine if you will that some
mathematician has invented a sequence of fractions which is infinitely long. When added together these fractions
are equal to pi... which consists of an infinite number of digits. Using a computer you can calculate pi 
*approximately* by adding up tens of thousands of these fractions. How accurate is the result? 


This is an excellent starter project. You can 
[read more about Pi from Py here.](https://github.com/robfatland/pythonbytes/tree/master/projects/pi#pythonbytes-project-in-depth)


### :star: Project: Pointless program


**You are consumed with writing a Python program that does something completely pointless.**


<img src="https://github.com/robfatland/pythonbytes/blob/master/projects/pointless/pointless.png" alt="drawing" width="280"/>


Inspired by Simone Giertz, this project insists that you write a Python program that runs correctly; with 
no errors. However what does it do??? It does something completely pointless. The challenge is to make that
pointless thing be really really ridiculous and goofy. Follow the link for some examples on just what we
mean by
[pointless](https://github.com/robfatland/pythonbytes/tree/master/projects/pointless#pythonbytes-project-in-depth).


### :star: Project: Adventure (Room Escape)


**Create a text adventure where a player must determine the right series of steps to escape from a locked room.**


[More on adventure here...](https://github.com/robfatland/pythonbytes/tree/master/projects/adventure#pythonbytes-project-in-depth)


### :star: Project: Simple game player with graphics


**Create a program that plays a simple game like tic-tac-toe or Nim against a human with graphics**


<img src="https://github.com/robfatland/pythonbytes/blob/master/projects/simplegame/tictactoe.png" alt="drawing" width="280"/>


Creating simple computer games where the computer takes one side is a time-tested way of improving your programming 
skills. This project idea has three parts: First create code that properly conducts the game. Second add some form of 
intelligence for your program so the game is interesting to the human player. Third add some graphics to make it more
interesting still!


Tic-tac-toe and Nim are two examples of games but there are dozens more. Here are the ones we recommend in order to 
build up your skills:

* Guess a number from 1 to 100: Computer is the Chooser and responds **higher** / **lower** / **got it!**
* Guess a number from 1 to 100: Computer is the Guesser and you (the player) are the Chooser
* Nim: Set a pile of stones; the program and the human take turns removing 1 to 3 stones; the last one to remove a stone loses
* Nim: Same as above but with three piles, for example with 9, 11, 13 stones
* [Old Gold](https://nrich.maths.org/1209): Click on the link to learn how to play this game

### :star: Project: Project Euler! 


**Many interesting project ideas can be found at [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/). We also 
have a pythonbytes *details* page on this topic
[here](https://github.com/robfatland/pythonbytes/tree/master/projects/euler#pythonbytes-project-in-depth).**


<img src="https://github.com/robfatland/pythonbytes/blob/master/projects/euler/euler.png" alt="drawing" width="280"/>


The **Project Euler** website has dozens of interesting programming challenges with mathematical themes. 
For example (Problem number 63): 

> The 5-digit number 16807 is also a fifth power: Seven raised to the fifth power. 
> Similarly, the 9-digit number 134217728 is also eight raised to the ninth power.
>
> How many n-digit positive integers exist which are also an n-th power?


Project Euler brings together your mathematical thinking (to help understand and evaluate the challenges) 
with your growing programming skills. Each project has a user-rating that you can see once you create an
account and begin to explore. A great feature is that you can submit your answers for evaluation.


### :dragon: Project: Solve a Sudoku puzzle


**Create a program that solves a Sudoku puzzle**


<img src="https://github.com/robfatland/pythonbytes/blob/master/projects/sudoku/sudoku.png" alt="drawing" width="280"/>


This project develops arithmetic and logic (Python) skills. If you are unfamiliar with Sudoku you
should learn about it and try some easy example puzzles first. Let's assume you have done so; now
how would you go about building a program that solves a Sudoku (instantly!). We describe one approach
here following the ideas of the great Jake VanderPlas. You can dive into the sudoku folder and read
the guidelines there... or you can begin right away without any hints and see how far you get. 


This is a fairly advanced project. You can 
[read more about Sudoku solvers here.](https://github.com/robfatland/pythonbytes/tree/master/projects/sudoku#pythonbytes-project-in-depth)




### :dragon: Project: Knight's Tour


**You have a chessboard and a knight placed upon it. Find a path of legal knight moves that visits every square once.**


<img src="https://github.com/robfatland/pythonbytes/blob/master/projects/knight/knight.png" alt="drawing" width="280"/>


This is another famous problem that can be solved with a good choice of algorithm. It also usually takes the 
form of a recursion problem; so here is a note on recursion. Suppose you want to add 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2.
One way to do this is to write a Python function that can call itself. This is a topic you will definitely
want to talk to Python Bytes coaches about.


You can play this game with a pencil and paper if you like. Simply draw an 8 x 8 chess board and write the number
1 in a corner square. Then proceed to write 2, 3, 4, ... on squares as you move about in the manner of a chess 
knight. If you get to the last empty square and write 64 you have solved the problem. 


Writing a Python program to solve this problem requires some careful thought and code-writing. It is much like
solving a maze which is one of our other project ideas.

### :dragon: Project: Video game


**Create an interactive video game using a Python package like [pygame](http://pygame.org)**


[More on video games here](https://github.com/robfatland/pythonbytes/tree/master/projects/videogame#pythonbytes-project-in-depth)


### :dragon: Project: Fractals I


**Use a simple procedure called the *Chaos Game* to create a fractal structure with infinite permiter and zero area**


The Chaos Game uses a geometric plane with three (or *n*) points and a random number generator. You begin anywhere
and follow a simple rule to determine which of the points is your target. You move half-way to that target and draw
a small dot. Then you repeat the procedure a large number of times until a pattern emerges. Advanced programmers 
may choose to play the Chaos Game in three dimensions, for example in the world of Minecraft. 


[More on these fractals here](https://github.com/robfatland/pythonbytes/tree/master/projects/fractals-I#pythonbytes-project-in-depth)


### :dragon: Project: Fortune Teller


**Create an interactive program: Ask the player some questions; then tell them something interesting.**


[More on fortune programs here](https://github.com/robfatland/pythonbytes/tree/master/projects/fortune#pythonbytes-project-in-depth)


### :dragon: Project: Maze Solver


**Create a program that is able to find its way out of a maze.**


[More on maze solvers here](https://github.com/robfatland/pythonbytes/tree/master/projects/maze#pythonbytes-project-in-depth)



### :dragon: Project: Fractals II


**Use the rules of complex arithmetic to create one of an infinite number of Julia Set fractals.**


<img src="https://github.com/robfatland/pythonbytes/blob/master/projects/fractals-II/juliaset.png" alt="drawing" width="280"/>


Fractals are geometrical objects that are self-similar: When you look at them up close they resemble themselves from
far away. 'So what!' I hear you saying. 'I look like myself from any distance!'  This is true; but when your friend looks
at your eyebrow she does not find that it is made from a hundred little tiny copies of you jumbled together to look like
an eyebrow. That's how fractals work, though. 


There is another project idea above on fractals called **fractals-I**. That is a great place to look first if you
have not already done so. It presents a simple game called the *Chaos Game* that produces a fractal. Here in **fractals-II**
we use a modified version of numbers and arithmetic to create a fractal called a Julia Set. 


[More on these fractals here](https://github.com/robfatland/pythonbytes/tree/master/projects/fractals-II#pythonbytes-project-in-depth)



### :dragon: Project: Whale calls


**You study whales and their calls... perhaps you would like to try and talk to them.**


I work with oceanographers who operate a grand observatory that sprawls across hundreds of miles along the floor of 
the Pacific ocean. They record underwater sounds for years at a time. Sometimes certain whales sing songs
that are recorded by the scientists' microphones. In this project you will learn to listen to, create pictures of, 
and identify whale calls.

[More on whale calls here](https://github.com/robfatland/pythonbytes/tree/master/projects/whales#pythonbytes-project-in-depth)



### :dragon: Minecraft landscapes


**It takes some extra set-up but you can learn to create fantastical things in Minecraft using Python**


<img src="https://github.com/robfatland/pythonbytes/blob/master/projects/minecraft/minecraft.png" alt="drawing" width="400"/>


What is required is that you have the game Minecraft installed on a PC or a Mac -- which I think costs about $25 --
and then you have to go through a few additional steps. Here is a nine-line program that creates chaos in Minecraft.

```
from mcpi.minecraft import Minecraft
from random import randint

mc = Minecraft.create()
p = mc.player.getPos()

for j in range(90, 180, 6):
    for i in range(0, 32, 4):
        for k in range(0, 32, 4):
            (dx, dy, dz, block) = (randint(-2, 2), randint(-3, 3), randint(-2,2), randint(0, 255))
            mc.setBlock(p.x - i + dx, j + dy, p.z + k + dz, block)
```

### :mountain: Poject: Stargirl


**Stargirl: You pilot a Tesla Roadster to escape the Jupiter system.**


<img src="https://github.com/robfatland/pythonbytes/blob/master/projects/stargirl/stargirl.png" alt="drawing" width="340"/>


You might say 'Python is a bit tricky but it's not Rocket Science!' but indeed how wrong you would be. This project 
creates a game putting the Player at the controls of a Tesla Roadster that still has some gas in its rocket engines. 
You are approaching the planet Jupiter and must use some controlled burns to slingshot yourself away using the
Jupiter itself and the four moons: Callisto, Europa, Io and Ganymede. 


<img src="https://github.com/robfatland/pythonbytes/blob/master/projects/stargirl/trajectories.png" alt="drawing" width="280"/>


[More on Stargirl here...](https://github.com/robfatland/pythonbytes/tree/master/projects/stargirl#pythonbytes-project-in-depth)


This project would be quite challenging if you are new to gravity. If you have a lot of experience with
gravity you will have some helpful intuition; and we can always give you some further help; come see us!
