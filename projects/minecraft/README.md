# Minecraft

What you can control:


- You can determine where a player is located
- You can set blocks anywhere to be of any type


Here is a random example

...and here is a motion tracker that follows the player's flight path...

How would you
create a mountain? A range of mountains? A lightning strike? A castle? A lake in the sky? Made of lava? 
A city made of glass? Portals to the Nether?


This project is not simple... and you will need your own computer. Talk to Rob about what is required.
