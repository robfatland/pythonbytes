# Nim Misere


Nim is a very simple game that will improve our Python programming skills in two stages. 
First we will write a program that plays the game legally; and then we will improve
that program so that it plays with skill.


## Rules of Nim


Two persons decide to play a game of Nim. Nim is a game of removing stones from a pile
in turns. Here is what happens.


* The players choose the number of stones in the pile 
  * From 8 to maybe 20 stones is a good range
* The players decide who is to go first (Player 1)
* Player 1 removes 1, 2 or 3 stones from the pile 
* Player 2 removes 1, 2 or 3 stones from the pile
* Players continue taking turns in this way until one player takes the last stone
  * That player who takes the last stone loses
  

## Rob's First Rule of Programming


Before trying to write some Python: Use a pencil and paper to play a few games of Nim. 
You can play just by yourself or you can play with a friend. After you play some games
of Nim what conclusions do you reach? 

> By the way: Losing by taking the last stone is called Nim Misere. You can also play
the game where the player who takes the last stone is the winner. No problems either
way but of course the strategy might change.


## Ingredients for this project


Our first goal is to write a computer program that plays Nim correctly. 
Here are some features of how this program should work. In this case 
we have Player 1 = the program and Player 2 = a human. 

* When the program begins: Ask the human for the number of stones
  * Make sure this is more than 4 and less than 30
* Make the human go first
  * You could also let the human decide if they want to go first or second
* Allow the human to take 1 or 2 or 3 stones
  * If they try to take a bad number of stones, like 5 or -3 stones: Don't allow this
* Once the player has chosen how many stones to remove: Print out the remaining pile 
  * For example: `13 stones remain     o o o o o o o o o o o o o`
* Now the program has to choose 1, 2, or 3 stones; so print this choice
  * `I choose to take 2 stones. 11 stones remain.`
  * Again print the pile of remaining stones `o o o o o o o o o o o`
* Keep repeating this until someone (the human or the program) takes the last stone
* Print out who won the game

### A useful ingredient: `input()`

As you may know we use `input()` to get information from the human. This provides us
with a variable of type `string`. If we wish to do math (like counting) with this
value we must first convert it to an *integer*. In Python we say an integer variable
is of type `int`. You can say `a_integer = int(a_string)` for example to do this 
conversion. Now you can use the `a_integer` variable as a number.

```
stones_string = input("How many stones should we begin with?")
```

Again: Before we go further with the program we should convert this *string* to a new 
variable of type *int*.


### Two more useful ingredients: `while` and `exit()`


Here are two things that could be used in a Nim program: `while` and `exit()`. 


`while` is a Python key word that creates a simple loop. 
It is like a simpler version of a `for` loop. 
Suppose we have this code: 


```
a = 3
while a > 2:
    print ('a is still greater than 2')
```

The indented code (inside the loop) will run over and over again as long as `a` is greater than `2`. 
Notice that the value of `a` never changes. This means that `a` will *always* be greater than `2`.
This code will therefore run forever! 
By forever I mean it will run until you stop the program yourself or until the computer falls apart.
If you try running this code you might eventually decide to stop it using ctrl-C. 


Let's do a nicer (non-infinite) version of a `while` loop: 


```
a = 3
while a < 10:
    print('a = ', a)
    a = a + 1

print('a is no longer less than 10. In fact a = ', a)
```

That takes care of `while` for a start. How about `exit(0)`? That is a function (not a key word) 
that stops the program from running any further. We tend to put them inside an `if` statement
so it amounts to `if something is going wrong just stop the program!`.


Suppose the player tries to remove an illegal number of stones -- like 10 -- and you think the program should
just stop. Here is a test program to see how this works. 


```
import os

player_stones = 10

if player_stones > 3:
    os.exit(0)

print("never printed this bit i bet")
```


Now let's combine these two ingredients `while` and `exit()` into one section of code. 
Predict what this program will do before you run it. 


```
import os

a = 7
while a < 20: 
    print('a = ', a)
    a = a + 1
    if a > 15:
        print('time to quit!')
        exit(0)
        print('but this will not print because it comes after the exit()')

print('this will not print either')
```

### Choosing a random number from 1 to 3


Here is the final ingredient needed for the first version of our Nim program. Remember this is 
the version that plays legally but not very skillfully. 


`randint()` is a Python function that produces a random integer. 
Run this program to see how `randint()` works. The first lime `from random import randint` is a bit 
of magic that we will explain later. There was similar magic up above when we had `import os`. But
we won't worry about this at the moment. 

```
from random import randint

for i in range(20):
    my_random_number = randint(4, 8)
    print(my_random_number)
```

How does `randint()` allow us to complete version one of our Nim program?
